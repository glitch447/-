			<h2> Get To Know Me! </h2>
			<h3> Skills/Proficiency </h3>
            <p>
                I have experience in Web Design, Game Design, and Programming. I have worked with HTML/CSS, Figma, Canva, Notion, and Python. I have basic responsive design skills, testing/debugging skills, and am currently learning 3D Modeling. I am always looking to learn new skills and improve upon the ones I already have.
            </p>
			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>
				I attended Prosser Career Academy from 2019-2023. I was a part of their International Baccalaureate (IB) program during those four years. The IB program enables students to direct their learning pathway and develop the skills they need for their future. I also participated in the JROTC Program, gaining essential teamwork and leadership skills. The two most memorable positions I had were as the Special Projects Officer (S-5) for the Battalion, where I was making newsletters about what we did each month (if you want to see here is one of them from December - January 2021-2022, <a href="Completed Falcon Battalion December-January SY 2021-2022 Newsletter.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here</a>) and Alpha Company Commander where I was in charge of around 60+ Cadets to help and motivate them to research a specific goal.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am attending Illinois State University as a Creative Technologies: Game Design major. I am part of the Honors Program on campus, where students are offered unique opportunities to think critically and gain essential leadership skills to prepare them to live in a diverse world outside of college. I am also part of the ADHD Club / The Neurodivergent Student Society on campus.
			</p>
			<h3>Prior Job Experience</h3>
			<p>
				I have worked with my father at his low-voltage business. This job entailed labeling, terminating and testing wires for networking, programming and installing Wi-Fi access points and Amazon Alexas, and installing cameras and TVs. I usually work with him during the summers.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also part of the fall 2024 Welcome Week Student Crew at Illinois State University. This job entails helping organize a team of students to set up a welcome week so that incoming freshmen feel more comfortable with their decision to join ISU, guiding students and their families to different parts of campus, and providing information to new Red Birds.
